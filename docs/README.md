## üìã Documentation Index

### Core Documentation
- **[Technical Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System overview, application architecture, and component relationships with detailed Mermaid diagrams
- **[API Documentation](./API.md)** - REST API endpoints, WebDAV interface, authentication, and code examples
- **[Database Schema](./DATABASE.md)** - Database design, table relationships, and migration strategies
- **[Security Architecture](./SECURITY.md)** - Security controls, authentication, authorization, and best practices
- **[Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Infrastructure setup, deployment procedures, and scaling strategies

## üéØ Quick Start

### For Developers
1. Read the [Technical Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the system design
2. Follow the development setup in the main [README.md](../README.md)
3. Review the [Security Architecture](./SECURITY.md) for security best practices
4. Explore the [API Documentation](./API.md) for programmatic access

### For System Administrators
1. Review the [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for infrastructure requirements
2. Study the [Database Schema](./DATABASE.md) for data management
3. Implement security measures from [Security Architecture](./SECURITY.md)
4. Set up monitoring as described in the deployment guide

### For API Users
1. Start with the [API Documentation](./API.md)
2. Review authentication methods and rate limiting
3. Explore code examples in your preferred language
4. Test with the provided endpoints and examples

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

Neocities is a web hosting platform built with:
- **Backend**: Ruby with Sinatra framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequel ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions and background jobs
- **Background Processing**: Sidekiq workers
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem or cloud storage
- **Security**: Multi-layer security with CSRF, CSP, and encryption

## üìä Architecture Diagrams

The documentation includes comprehensive Mermaid diagrams showing:
- System overview and component relationships
- Application architecture and request flow
- Database entity relationships
- API architecture and authentication flow
- Security architecture and protection layers
- Background job processing flow
- Deployment and infrastructure architecture
- Data flow diagrams for key operations

## üîí Security Features

Comprehensive security implementation including:
- **Authentication**: BCrypt password hashing, session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: File type validation, content sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy, output encoding
- **Rate Limiting**: API and upload rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and anomaly detection

## üöÄ API Capabilities

Full-featured API supporting:
- **REST Endpoints**: Site information, file listing, upload, delete
- **WebDAV Interface**: Standard WebDAV protocol for file management
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth and API token authentication
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, delete, rename operations
- **Metadata Access**: Site statistics, file information, user data

## üìà Scalability

Designed for scale with:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple application servers with load balancing
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching and CDN integration
- **Background Processing**: Scalable Sidekiq worker processes
- **File Storage**: Distributed storage options

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Development best practices:
- **Code Organization**: Modular Sinatra architecture
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Minitest
- **Security**: Security-first development practices
- **Performance**: Database optimization and caching
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation and architectural decisions
